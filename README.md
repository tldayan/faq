# FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project represents my solution for the FAQ Accordion Card challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create an interactive FAQ accordion card that allows users to expand and collapse the answers to frequently asked questions.

## Overview

The FAQ Accordion Card challenge focused on building a dynamic and user-friendly card that effectively presents a list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers. The goal was to create a design that promotes ease of use and enhances the user experience.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS. The objective was to create an engaging FAQ card that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, while utilizing JavaScript to handle the accordion functionality.

By leveraging SCSS, I aimed to enhance the styling process by utilizing variables, mixins, and nested rules. This allowed for cleaner and more maintainable code, resulting in a well-organized and visually appealing design.
